Animated Enemy Simulation on Canvas
Project Overview
This project creates an animated simulation of a swarm of enemy sprites on an HTML canvas using JavaScript. It demonstrates key concepts such as object-oriented programming, sprite-based animation, and frame-based updates to simulate dynamic movement and behavior for multiple objects.

#Features
Randomized movement and behavior for a dynamic and lively animation.
Sprite-based animation with smooth frame updates.
Configurable number of enemy sprites for varied animation density.
#Technologies Used
-HTML5 Canvas for rendering graphics.
-JavaScript for animation logic and object management.
-CSS for basic styling and canvas dimensions.
#Setup Instructions
Clone or download the project files.
Open the HTML file in a compatible web browser.
Ensure that the JavaScript and canvas elements are correctly linked.
Example HTML structure:

html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Canvas Animation</title>
    <script src="your-js-file.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="canvas1"></canvas>
</body>
</html>
#Usage Guide
After opening the HTML file, the animation will automatically start.
Watch as enemy sprites move randomly across the canvas, with varying speeds and directions.
To stop the animation, close the browser tab or stop the execution in your development environment.
#Customization Options
Number of Enemies: Adjust the numberOfEnimies variable in the JavaScript file to increase or decrease the number of enemies on the canvas.
Movement Behavior: Modify the logic in the update() method to change enemy speed, direction, or flap speed.
Sprite Image: Change the image.src property to use a different sprite sheet or image for the enemy appearance.
#Applications
Use this project as a base for more complex animations, such as games or simulations with multiple moving objects.
Extend it with interactive elements, collision detection, or game mechanics to create a more complete game experience.
Customize the sprite images to create different themes or enemy types.
