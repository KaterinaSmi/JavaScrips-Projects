## Description

This is a page for match followers. It could be a great option for sport commentators or just visitors of the game who would like to share game's info with those who stayed home. School games can be a great choice. Parents who could not come can follow the game from home. User is able to add score of the game, location, time and check tickets' price.
1. There is a dropdown in the left top corner, where you can find 4 options: score container with two teams and their scores, reset button for lose up to "0"; time, where you can see current time; location (unfortunatelly constant,not changable), and ticket calculator(free from 1-7 y.o,8-10 y.o-10 euros, 11-23 y.o-15 euros,older - 20 euros). If user type in not a number or >0 years=> calculator will ask to type in valid age.
After drop down there is another container that is included in "displays" for hide and show option-"Show player" this is a checkbox, when is checked, there is a list of today's players' names, last names and number. User is able to add name, last name and number as well as delete using "insert" and "delete" buttons. It is not created as a table, but as a container with 3 columns, styled with css. "delete" button is used to delete all players, none of them is fixed.
